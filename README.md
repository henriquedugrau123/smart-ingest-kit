# smart-ingest-kit
Stop using static chunk sizes. A lightweight, production-ready RAG ingestion toolkit. Uses Docling for layout-aware parsing and applies smart heuristics for optimal chunking (PDF vs Code vs MD). Extracted from a production RAG platform

Love this tool? This is just a small part of a bigger vision.

This PDF table parser is a core component of a much larger, private-by-design AI platform I'm building. It's designed to be the central, searchable brain for all your personal and business data. 
If you're tired of generic AI solutions and believe in the power of data privacy, follow the journey.  https://mailchi.mp/38a074f598a3/github_catcher
